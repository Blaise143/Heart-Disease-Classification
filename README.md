# Heart Disease Classification
In this project, I used different machine learning algorithms to on health data to come up with a model that can predict a heart disease subtype given data.
### Note: 
This project has interactive charts that do not show up on github. To view the nice rendering of the notebook, click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Blaise143/Heart-Disease-Classification/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb) or clone this repository and run the project on your local computer.

Below are a few plots from the Exploratory Data Analysis performed on this dataset:

## Concepts used in this project
- Data cleaning and data Exploration with `Pandas`
- Interactive Data Visualization with `Altair`
- Data preprocessing in preparation for modelling
- Machine learning modelling with `Support Vector Machines` and `Random Forest`
- Model Evaluation
 
## How to recreate this project:
- Install dependencies namely : `Pandas`, `sklearn`, `numpy`, `Altair`
- Clone or Download this repository and open it in a preffered IDE (I preffer Jupyter Notebooks with Anaconda)
- Open the `Analysis.ipynb` file and run the cells 
 
# Happy Coding!!!!!!
